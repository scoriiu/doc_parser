THE  diagnosis  of  primary  hyperparathyroidism (HPTH) has become commonplace since the introduc- tion  of  routine  multiple  biochemical  analysis  ( I ,   2). Many of these patients d o  not have any clinical features of the disease. The decision to operate on such patients must  be  based  on  an  estimate  of  risks  and  benefits involved.  This  study  investigates  the  extent  of  sub- clinical disease present in such \u2018asymptomatic\u2019 patients and  the  changes  following  parathyroid  surgery.

COOKE,  J.  H.  BOEY,  E.  C.  SWEENEY, J.  M.  GILBERT AND SELWYN TAYLOR* SUMMARY Opinion is divided as to the  necessary extent of para- thyroid  resection in  primary  hyperparathyroidism. Some surgeons urge that subtotal parathyroidectomy be performed  routinely,  while  others  reserve  subtotal resections for patients with parathyroid  hyperplasia. In a  review of  102 patients  treated  by parathyroid- ectomy  for  primary  hyperparathyroidism  and  subse- quently followed  up for  an  average  of  6  years,  there were  73 patients  with parathyroid  adenoma,  26  with hyperplasia and 3 with carcinoma. The adenoma was not found at the first operation in only 3 cases; in the other 70 after  removal of the adenoma no further hypercal- caemia  was  observed  during  the  follow-up  period. Persistent  or  recurrent hypercalcaemia was a problem in 9 out of the 26patients with primary hyperplasia who had inadequate resection at the first operation, and also in the 3 patients  with carcinoma. Experience  shows  that  peroperative  biopsy  with frozen  section  of  all  the  parathyroids  is  useful  in confirming their identity and can be a guide to the type of  disease  present  and  the  appropriate  extent  of resection. THE first  successful parathyroidectomy was  reported in 1926 by  Mandl of Vienna. His patient was relieved of severe metabolic bone disease following removal of a  large  parathyroid  adenoma.  A  decade  later, clinicians  became  aware that  in  some patients with primary  hyperparathyroidism  all  four  parathyroid glands might be enlarged. They introduced the term \u2018diffuse hyperplasia of the Parathyroids\u2019 to distinguish such patients from those having the much commoner parathyroid adenoma (Albright et al.,  1934; Cope et al., 1958).

EINARSSONFrom the Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Serafimerlasarettet, Stockholm, SwedenSUMMARY The frequency of gallstone disease was studied in a group of 82 subjects (69 femalesand 13 males; mean ages 55*0 and 52-3 years, respectively) with verified hypercalcaemia (VHC)detected in a health screening in the Stockholm area. All non-cholecystectomised subjects wereexamined with a peroral cholecystography. Causes of hypercalcaemia other than primary hyper-parathyroidism (PHPT) had been excluded as far as possible. Sixty-two patients had been operatedupon and all but two males were found to have parathyroid adenomas. The patients were comparedwith a series of 82 normocalcaemic age- and sex-matched subjects, selected from the health screen-ing register. The patients with VHC and/or PHPT had about the same frequency of gallstonedisease as the controls. The results are at variance with those of other investigators who have reportedthat PHPT is associated with an abnormally high frequency of gallstone disease. Possible explana-tions of the discrepancy in results is discussed.The development of gallstones in man has beenascribed to a variety of aetiological factors anddiseases have been associated with anseveralincreased prevalence of complaints involving gall-stones (cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholecystectomy).Clinical studies (Robertson, 1945; Friedman et al.,1966) and necropsy series (Sternby, 1968; Zahor etal., 1974) have demonstrated that the prevalence ofcholelithiasis increases with age and that it is higherin women than in men. Overweight, parity, hyper-triglyceridaemia, and diabetes mellitus have beenassociated with an increased prevalence (Lieber,1952; van der Linden, 1961; Friedman et al., 1966;1970; Sturdevant et al., 1973;Wheeler et al.,Zahor et al., 1974; Einarsson et al., 1975).

CANARY, M.D.Analysis of a series of 200 surgically treated cases of primaryhyperparathyroidism was carried out in an effort to identify notonly the changing clinical patterns and improved diagnosticmethods but also to assess the long term results of our con-ventional operative methods in light of recent reports of ahigh incidence of diffuse hyperplasia and a high recurrencerate when surgery is restricted to removal of the adenoma.As reported by others the \"chemical diagnosis\" of primaryhyperparathyroidism, the clinical setting in which unsuspectedhypercalcemia is demonstrated on routine blood analysis, ac-counts for the majority of diagnoses today. Impending or actual\"parathyroid crisis\" has been observed with alarming fre-quency. The use of the thiazide challenge test provides auseful diagnostic aid in many instances. The incidence ofdiffuse hyperplasia was 6% in this series while an adenomawas present in 88%. No instance of recurrence was ob-served in either the cases of adenomas or diffuse hyperplasia.T HE SURGICAL TREATMENT of primary hyperpara-thyroidism has become the center of considerablecontroversy. In 1964 we reported our earlier experi-ences at a meeting of the Southern Surgical Asso-ciation.5 It was our belief that the responsible lesionin the great majority of the cases was a single adenoma,removal of which permanently controlled this disorder.Since then Haff,6'7 Ballinger' and Paloyan9 have ad-vanced the thesis that approximately half of the pa-tients with so-called adenomas have in reality a formof localized hyperplasia. They advocate removal ofthree to three and a half parathyroid glands in allpatients with adenomas to prevent a significant rate ofrecurrence.

The resulting hypercalcemia is caused by the autogenous production of excessive para\u00adthyroid hormone. This is usually caused by a solitary functioning parathyroid adenoma, but may be the result of parathyroid hyper\u00adplasia, or, very rarely, parathyroid carci\u00adnoma.In recent years, more and more indi\u00adviduals have been found to have significant hypercalcemia: the problem of identifying those who have primary parathyroid disease is an arresting one. The very numbers of the possible candidates has suggested that physicians cannot assert categorically that hypercalcemia does, in fact, lead inevitably to the unpleasant secondary stigmata of parathyroid adenomatous disease.Several studies of large groups of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have been reported, ^ However, a review of the last 16 years\u2019 experience in our referral center suggests trends that do not neces\u00adsarily agree with the findings of others.Reprint requests to: Dr. Jelenko, Dept, of Sur\u00adgery, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Ga. 30902.Presented at the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Southeastern Surgical Congress, Atlanta, Ga., Apr. 8-11, 1974.139From the time of the opening of Eugene Talmadge Memorial Hospital of the Med\u00adical College of Georgia in 1956 through December 1972, 46 patients have had their diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism confirmed by operation (43 patients) or by autopsy (3 patients).In this report we analyze the informa\u00adtion gained from these individuals in terms of etiology, symptomatology, diagnosis, treatment and therapeutic results.Incidence and SymptomsThe apparent incidence of parathyroid adenomatous disease has increased in re\u00adcent years with the use of multich"

Among these patients, there was no sex preponder-ance. The pathologic findings at parathyroid surgery, as well asthe features of peptic ulcer disease, were the same as in patientswith primary hyperparathyroidism or with peptic ulcer diseasealone. The ulcer symptoms of 58% of the patients with adequatefollow up improved after parathyroidectomy. Sixty-six percent ofthe patients who had active peptic ulcer disease at surgeryimproved as compared with only 44% of the patients who hadcomplicated peptic ulcer disease. None of the factors studied(age, sex, serum calcium and serum parathyroid hormone levels,location, and duration of ulcer) had any effect on the peptic ulcersymptoms after parathyroidectomy.

For an additional 9 patients, no operation was advised, usuallybecause of other life-endangering disease and the presence of only a mild degree ofhypercalcemia without complications. In recent years, nearly 50 per cent of thepatients did not have renal calculi or osteitis fibrosa cystica; this was unrelated toage. Most of the patients with management problems were seen since 1965. Agealone was not a dominantin relation to serious complications fromthe presence of other critical disease increasing the risk ofhypercalcemia,operation, or the development of major postoperative complications. The only deathfrom primary hyperparathyroidism occurred in a 74-year-old patient who refusedre-operation and died from an acute hypercalcemic crisis. A liberal, but selective,policy of surgical treatment is justified for primary hyperparathyroidism in theelderly. Patients for whom the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism isestablished may be separated into three groups: those for whom early operation isindicated, those for whom operation should be delayed to permit recovery from otherlife-endangering acute disease, and those for whom operation is unjustified becauseof minimal uncomplicated hypercalcemia and other serious disease greatly limitinglife expectancy. These categories encompass all age groups and are not restricted tothe elderly.

Hill, MD, Torrance, California In the past, patients with primary hyperparathy- roidism were diagnosed only when overt classic clinical findings usually relating to pathology of the kidney (lithiasis, calcinosis) and/or bone (osteopo- rosis, von Recklinghausen\u2019s disease) directed atten- tion to the problem. The few operations performed annually for this condition at most medical centers were the occasion of considerable interest on the part of the surgical, medical, and pathology staffs, and too frequently, even though an adenoma was discovered, the usual extensive damage to the kidneys was not followed by a return to normal function of this organ. With the advent of automated equipment for blood chemistry determinations, the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism has been made much earlier in symptomatic patients, but in addition hy- percalcemia has been uncovered in patients who are asymptomatic. The frequency with which the latter occurred raised questions as to whether primary hyperparathyroidism was a much more common disease than anticipated, and what should be done for these patients-perform surgery or observe them for future developments? We have taken the former course and our experience is reported herein. Material and Methods The records of 136 patients who underwent surgery for hyperparathyroidism were reviewed. Of this group, fifty- three patients were considered to be asymptomatic. They were patients seen for a variety of medical reasons, such as routine periodic physical examinations, varicose veins, hernias, uterine fibroids, and benign breast masses. At- tention was drawn to the possibility of hyperparathy- roidism only by an unexpected presence of an elevated blood calcium level on a sequential multiple analyzer (SMA-12) print out. The upper normal limit of serum calcium level was considered to be 10.8 mg/lOO ml when accompanied by normal plasma proteins"
