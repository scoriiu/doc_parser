COOKE,  J.  H.  BOEY,  E.  C.  SWEENEY, J.  M.  GILBERT AND SELWYN TAYLOR* SUMMARY Opinion is divided as to the  necessary extent of para- thyroid  resection in  primary  hyperparathyroidism. Some surgeons urge that subtotal parathyroidectomy be performed  routinely,  while  others  reserve  subtotal resections for patients with parathyroid  hyperplasia. In a  review of  102 patients  treated  by parathyroid- ectomy  for  primary  hyperparathyroidism  and  subse- quently followed  up for  an  average  of  6  years,  there were  73 patients  with parathyroid  adenoma,  26  with hyperplasia and 3 with carcinoma. The adenoma was not found at the first operation in only 3 cases; in the other 70 after  removal of the adenoma no further hypercal- caemia  was  observed  during  the  follow-up  period. Persistent  or  recurrent hypercalcaemia was a problem in 9 out of the 26patients with primary hyperplasia who had inadequate resection at the first operation, and also in the 3 patients  with carcinoma. Experience  shows  that  peroperative  biopsy  with frozen  section  of  all  the  parathyroids  is  useful  in confirming their identity and can be a guide to the type of  disease  present  and  the  appropriate  extent  of resection. THE first  successful parathyroidectomy was  reported in 1926 by  Mandl of Vienna. His patient was relieved of severe metabolic bone disease following removal of a  large  parathyroid  adenoma.  A  decade  later, clinicians  became  aware that  in  some patients with primary  hyperparathyroidism  all  four  parathyroid glands might be enlarged. They introduced the term \u2018diffuse hyperplasia of the Parathyroids\u2019 to distinguish such patients from those having the much commoner parathyroid adenoma (Albright et al.,  1934; Cope et al., 1958).

All non-cholecystectomised subjects wereexamined with a peroral cholecystography. Causes of hypercalcaemia other than primary hyper-parathyroidism (PHPT) had been excluded as far as possible. Sixty-two patients had been operatedupon and all but two males were found to have parathyroid adenomas. The patients were comparedwith a series of 82 normocalcaemic age- and sex-matched subjects, selected from the health screen-ing register. The patients with VHC and/or PHPT had about the same frequency of gallstonedisease as the controls. The results are at variance with those of other investigators who have reportedthat PHPT is associated with an abnormally high frequency of gallstone disease. Possible explana-tions of the discrepancy in results is discussed.The development of gallstones in man has beenascribed to a variety of aetiological factors anddiseases have been associated with anseveralincreased prevalence of complaints involving gall-stones (cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholecystectomy).Clinical studies (Robertson, 1945; Friedman et al.,1966) and necropsy series (Sternby, 1968; Zahor etal., 1974) have demonstrated that the prevalence ofcholelithiasis increases with age and that it is higherin women than in men. Overweight, parity, hyper-triglyceridaemia, and diabetes mellitus have beenassociated with an increased prevalence (Lieber,1952; van der Linden, 1961; Friedman et al., 1966;1970; Sturdevant et al., 1973;Wheeler et al.,Zahor et al., 1974; Einarsson et al., 1975).

Impending or actual\"parathyroid crisis\" has been observed with alarming fre-quency. The use of the thiazide challenge test provides auseful diagnostic aid in many instances. The incidence ofdiffuse hyperplasia was 6% in this series while an adenomawas present in 88%. No instance of recurrence was ob-served in either the cases of adenomas or diffuse hyperplasia.T HE SURGICAL TREATMENT of primary hyperpara-thyroidism has become the center of considerablecontroversy. In 1964 we reported our earlier experi-ences at a meeting of the Southern Surgical Asso-ciation.5 It was our belief that the responsible lesionin the great majority of the cases was a single adenoma,removal of which permanently controlled this disorder.Since then Haff,6'7 Ballinger' and Paloyan9 have ad-vanced the thesis that approximately half of the pa-tients with so-called adenomas have in reality a formof localized hyperplasia.

The resulting hypercalcemia is caused by the autogenous production of excessive para\u00adthyroid hormone. This is usually caused by a solitary functioning parathyroid adenoma, but may be the result of parathyroid hyper\u00adplasia, or, very rarely, parathyroid carci\u00adnoma.In recent years, more and more indi\u00adviduals have been found to have significant hypercalcemia: the problem of identifying those who have primary parathyroid disease is an arresting one. The very numbers of the possible candidates has suggested that physicians cannot assert categorically that hypercalcemia does, in fact, lead inevitably to the unpleasant secondary stigmata of parathyroid adenomatous disease.Several studies of large groups of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have been reported, ^ However, a review of the last 16 years\u2019 experience in our referral center suggests trends that do not neces\u00adsarily agree with the findings of others.Reprint requests to: Dr. Jelenko, Dept, of Sur\u00adgery, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Ga. 30902.Presented at the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Southeastern Surgical Congress, Atlanta, Ga., Apr. 8-11, 1974.139From the time of the opening of Eugene Talmadge Memorial Hospital of the Med\u00adical College of Georgia in 1956 through December 1972, 46 patients have had their diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism confirmed by operation (43 patients) or by autopsy (3 patients).In this report we analyze the informa\u00adtion gained from these individuals in terms of etiology, symptomatology, diagnosis, treatment and therapeutic results.Incidence and SymptomsThe apparent incidence of parathyroid adenomatous disease has increased in re\u00adcent years with the use of multich"

Sixty-six percent ofthe patients who had active peptic ulcer disease at surgeryimproved as compared with only 44% of the patients who hadcomplicated peptic ulcer disease. None of the factors studied(age, sex, serum calcium and serum parathyroid hormone levels,location, and duration of ulcer) had any effect on the peptic ulcersymptoms after parathyroidectomy. Our results and a criticalreview of the experimental and clinical literature suggest that theassociation between primary hyperparathyroidism and pepticulcer disease is no more than coincidental.(Arch Surg 113:384-386, 1978)In the late 1920s and early 1930s, mention was made ofgastrointestinal symptoms in patients with hyperpara\u00acthyroidism.,:l In 1946, Rogers' first postulated a definiterelationship between peptic ulcer disease and hyperpara\u00acthyroidism.Although many studies during the past 30 years havetried to evaluate this relationship and assess the effect ofprimary hyperparathyroidism on peptic ulcer disease, thissubject remains controversial. Attempting to answer someof these questions, we critically reviewed the histories of 46patients with proved concomitant primary hyperparathy\u00acroidism and peptic ulcer disease. We were particularlyinterested in the effects of parathyroid surgery on theclinical course of peptic ulcer disease.MATERIALS AND M"

BLOCK, MD* *, ALFREDO XAVIER, MDt and BROCK E. BRUSH, MD:j:Department of General Surgery, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MichiganfactorABSTRACT: Of 166 surgical patients for whom the diagnosis of primaryhyperparathyroidism was established over a 20-year period, about one-third wereover 60 years of age. For an additional 9 patients, no operation was advised, usuallybecause of other life-endangering disease and the presence of only a mild degree ofhypercalcemia without complications. In recent years, nearly 50 per cent of thepatients did not have renal calculi or osteitis fibrosa cystica; this was unrelated toage. Most of the patients with management problems were seen since 1965. Agealone was not a dominantin relation to serious complications fromthe presence of other critical disease increasing the risk ofhypercalcemia,operation, or the development of major postoperative complications. The only deathfrom primary hyperparathyroidism occurred in a 74-year-old patient who refusedre-operation and died from an acute hypercalcemic crisis. A liberal, but selective,policy of surgical treatment is justified for primary hyperparathyroidism in theelderly. Patients for whom the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism isestablished may be separated into three groups: those for whom early operation isindicated, those for whom operation should be delayed to permit recovery from otherlife-endangering acute disease, and those for whom operation is unjustified becauseof minimal uncomplicated hypercalcemia and other serious disease greatly limitinglife expectancy. These categories encompass all age groups and are not restricted tothe elderly. All patients require periodic re-evaluation.\u2022 Presented atthe 32nd Annual Meeting of the AmericanGeriatrics Society, Eden Roc Hotel, Miami Beach, F"
